# Clothing Store Database using SQL

This project involves the creation of a clothing store database using SQL. The database includes a "store" table with columns for item ID, item name, category, price, quantity, and color. The data is populated using SQL INSERT statements. Various SQL queries are then used to analyze the data, including displaying the entire database ordered by price, finding the total cost of all skirts in the database, and determining the average price of an item in the store.

## Technologies
- SQL

## Installation
1. Install a SQL database management system such as MySQL or PostgreSQL.
2. Copy and paste the SQL code from `clothing_store_database.sql` into the database management system's SQL editor.
3. Run the SQL code to create the `store` table and populate it with data.

## Usage
- Run the SQL queries in `clothing_store_database.sql` to analyze the data in the `store` table.
- Modify the SQL code to create your own clothing store database with custom data.
